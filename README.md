# Digital-Watch

In this project, I:

• Designed a digital watch using VHDL.

• Implemented functionality for a countdown, date and time, and stopwatch.

• Used Quartus to synthesize and ModelSim to simulate implementation.

To run the program, download the entire folder and extract it into the one working directory. Next, start up Quartus and open digitalwatch.qpf. Here, you can synthesize the program and change the pins to your liking. It is currently set up for the Terasic DE10 Lite board. The repository contains images displaying a timing diagram of the working product. The ModelSim simulation files can be found under workingdirectory/simulation/modelsim.

Note: All the files of the project can be attained by downloading digitalwatch.zip. I have attached a separate copy of digitalwatch.vhd file for viewing purposes.

If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
